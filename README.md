Sooo... just walked out of Dual, my mind’s doing cartwheels or maybe just slipping on popcorn. Why do I always manage to leave a Hansel and Gretel trail of crumbs wherever I go? My back’s a bundle of complaints too, that damn theater chair. Anyway, the movie, the movie. Why can’t I just focus? Gotta douse it out in words.

There was that scene with the two versions of her, like one was real and the other... a carbon copy but made from recycled cardboard dreams. Felt like the time I tried making a souffle without eggs. Who does that? Her eyes when they did the thing with the thing, I swear, could peel onions. Speaking of onions, remind me to download the movie. Joanna wanted it for that weird film club thing she calls a book club. 

> That moment when they stared each other down, it was like the soufflés collapsing—all that tension and a hint of burnt sugar floating in. My head’s like a washing machine on the fritz, bumping around scenes with no particular order. 

Noise in the theater was like a surreal soundtrack, someone's phone kept buzzing, maybe their imaginary friend called. The duality of it all, like when you taste something that’s salty and sweet and bitter and can’t tell if it’s pure genius or a culinary disaster. Should I watch the movie again? Or will it be like reheated frittata—never quite the same.

The intensity between them, doppelgangers squaring off in a ballet of awkwardness—like my first time slicing sashimi, hands shaking, fish looking back at me with accusation. And the mother in the story, how she just sat there, letting it all unfold like a slow-cooked stew left out in the rain.

Oh, yeah, download the movie if you want to see. Do it at some point. Can’t even think straight, typing with fingers coated in butter-flavored despair.
